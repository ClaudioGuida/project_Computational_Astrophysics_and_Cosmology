# Project Computational Astrophysics and Cosmology
This is the exam project for the Computational Astrophysics and Cosmology course taught by Dr. Alfonso Veropalumbo and Prof. Marco Raveri.

In this project, I measured the power spectrum from the BOSS galaxy catalog using the Euclid data analysis pipeline. I compared the shape of the obtained power spectrum with that of BOSS and performed a fit on the growth factor.

For both the plots and the fit, I estimated the errors using the covariance matrix computed with the GaussianCovariance code, which implements the Gaussian approximation following the model presented in Grieb et al. (2016) https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04293.
